This book is the result of a student projects for [Sace Studies](https://github.com/mini-pw/2020L-WarsztatyBadawcze) course at the Warsaw University of Technology. Each team prepared an article on one of the topics selected from reproducibility, imputation, and interpretability.

This project is inspired by a book [Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods](https://compstat-lmu.github.io/iml_methods_limitations/) created at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich.
We used the LIML project as the cornerstone for this repository.
